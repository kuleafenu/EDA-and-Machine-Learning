# MORTGAGE LOAN AQUISITION REQUIREMENT
This entire project encompasses both Data Analysis and Machine Learning. 
It was carefully structured and compiled for easy understanding.

### Installation:

To run this notebook you can either install.
* Download anaconda from [anaconda site](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) this have almost all dependencies pre-installed.
Feel free to use any environment of choice

#### Dependencies:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [IPython](http://ipython.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)


### Personal project | Mortgage loan elegibility prediction

>The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose information about mortgages.
>These public data are important because:
 *  + they help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities.
    + help authourities to determine and fish out all predatory act of lending.
    + they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies.
    + They shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory.
Eg. a reported increase in mortgage borrowing by blacks and Hispanics as of 1993.

### Goal for this Notebook:
Show a simple example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python using a full complement of PyData utilities. This is aimed for those looking to get into the field Data Science or those who are already in the field and looking to see a real world analysis done with Python.

#### This Notebook will teach the following:
#### Data Handling
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Cleaning Data
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

#### Data Analysis
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
    +   Logit Regression Model
    +   Plotting results
    +   Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels
    +   Basic Random Forest
    +   Plotting results

#### Valuation of the Analysis
*   K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
*   Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle


### Benchmark Scripts
To find the basic scripts for the competition benchmarks look in the "Python Examples" folder. These scripts are based on the originals provided by Astro Dave but have been reworked so that they are easier to understand for new comers.
